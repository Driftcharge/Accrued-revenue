		<h1>Accrued Revenue</h1>
		<p><strong>Accrued revenue</strong> is a core revenue recognition concept for subscription, SaaS, and service-based businesses. This page explains what it is, why it matters, and how it appears in your accounting.</p>
	</header>

	<section class="section-block">
		<h2>What is accrued revenue?</h2>
		<p>Accrued revenue is income that a business has already earned but hasn’t been paid for yet. You’ve delivered the product or service, but the customer hasn’t paid — at least not yet.</p>
		<p>Even though the cash hasn’t arrived, that income is still recorded as revenue in your books because the work is complete and the customer owes the amount.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="section-block">
		<h2>Why does accrued revenue matter?</h2>
		<p>Accrued revenue keeps your financial reporting honest. It recognizes revenue when it’s earned — not only when the payment hits your bank account.</p>
		<p>This is important for understanding true profitability, planning cash flow, and reporting performance accurately. It’s especially relevant for companies that run on subscriptions or ongoing services.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="section-block">
		<h2>Is accrued revenue an asset?</h2>
		<p>Yes. In accounting terms, accrued revenue is considered an <strong>asset</strong> because it represents money that will come in later.</p>
		<p>It sits on the balance sheet under <strong>accounts receivable</strong> until payment is actually collected from the customer.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="section-block">
		<h2>Accrued revenue vs deferred revenue</h2>
		<p>Accrued revenue and deferred revenue behave in opposite ways:</p>
		<p><strong>Accrued revenue:</strong> You’ve delivered the work already, and you’re waiting for payment. You record it as earned revenue now.</p>
		<p><strong>Deferred revenue:</strong> The customer has already paid, but you haven’t delivered the product or service yet. You can’t count it as earned revenue until delivery happens.</p>
		<p>Both are important for cash flow visibility, especially in ecommerce and subscription businesses.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="section-block">
		<h2>Example of accrued revenue</h2>
		<p>Imagine you run a subscription service and invoice a client for a 3-month plan that starts today.</p>
		<p>You don’t wait until the end of the 3 months to book all that income. Instead, you record one-third of the revenue each month as service is delivered, even if the full payment comes later.</p>
		<p>That monthly portion is accrued revenue: earned now, collected later.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="section-block tip-box">
		<h3>Driftcharge Tip</h3>
		<p>If you’re running a subscription or recurring billing model, tracking accrued revenue helps you understand what’s already earned versus what’s still outstanding.</p>
		<p>Make sure your billing and reporting tools handle both <strong>accrued revenue</strong> (earned now, paid later) and <strong>deferred revenue</strong> (paid now, earned later). That view is critical for forecasting and investor reporting.</p>

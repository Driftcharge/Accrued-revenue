# Accrued Revenue

Accrued revenue is an important concept in subscription billing, SaaS, and service-based businesses. This README explains what it means, why it matters, and how it’s treated in accounting terms.

## What is accrued revenue?

**Accrued revenue** is income a business has already earned but hasn’t received payment for yet.

In other words: you’ve already delivered the product or service, but the customer hasn’t paid (at least not yet). Even though the cash hasn’t come in, that income is still recorded as revenue on your books.

## Why does accrued revenue matter?

Tracking accrued revenue helps you understand true performance by recognizing revenue when it’s earned — not just when the payment arrives.

That matters for:
- Seeing real profitability
- Planning cash flow
- Accurate financial reporting

This is especially important for subscription-driven or service-based businesses, where work is delivered continuously but payment may be delayed.

## Is accrued revenue an asset?

Yes.

In accounting, accrued revenue is treated as an **asset** because it represents money that will come in later. On the balance sheet, it sits under **accounts receivable** until the customer actually pays.

## Accrued Revenue vs Deferred Revenue

These are basically opposites:

- **Accrued revenue:**  
  You’ve done the work. The customer hasn’t paid yet. You record the revenue now.

- **Deferred revenue:**  
  The customer has already paid you, but you haven’t delivered the product or service yet. You can’t recognize that as earned revenue until delivery happens.

Both concepts are critical in ecommerce, SaaS, and subscription businesses for proper revenue recognition and cash flow management.

## Example of accrued revenue

Let’s say you run a subscription business and invoice a client for a 3-month service that starts today.

You don’t wait three months to recognize all of that revenue at once. Instead, you record one-third of the revenue each month as the service is delivered — even if the actual cash is collected later.

That monthly portion you record is accrued revenue.

## Driftcharge Tip

If you run a subscription or recurring billing model, tracking accrued revenue gives you a clear view of what’s already earned (even if not yet collected).

Make sure your financial tools or reporting process are tracking both:
- **Accrued revenue** (earned now, paid later)
- **Deferred revenue** (paid now, earned later)

This helps you understand which money is guaranteed vs. which money is still tied to future delivery.
